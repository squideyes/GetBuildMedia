**GetBuildMedia** downloads select audio and video files from the recent Build2020 conference, sourced from Microsoft's Channel 9.  

The software should be pretty easy to use:  

* **Select** one or more episodes to download
* Check "**Fetch Videos**" and/or "**Fetch Audios**" to select the type(s) of media you'd like to download
* You can **filter** the displayed episodes by entering search text in the Filter Box; at top center.
* Once you've selected one or more episodes, click on the "**Fetch**" button to begin the download process.
* Downloaded media may be played by clicking on one of the "**Play**" buttons
    * The play buttons will be disabled until media is downloaded.
    * The media is **downloaded to \{My Documents}\GetBuildMedia** folder
